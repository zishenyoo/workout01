# workout01
General Instructions
• Create a folder (i.e. subdirectory) workout01 which will contain all the other subdirectories
and files produced for this HW.
• The folder workout01 (and its contents) will have to be part of a git repository in
your computer, that is associated to the github classroom repository for Stat 133.
Don’t worry about how to do this; we’ll provide more information in lab, and in some
supporting documentation.
• Create a README.md file and include a clear description of what the HW is about.
• Create a folder data which will contain the data files.
• Create a folder code which will contain the R script files.
• Create a folder output which will contain some R outputs.
• Create a folder images which will contain some plot images.
• Create a folder report which will contain the files for your dynamic document (e.g.
Rmd and derived files).
• In the yaml header of the Rmd file, set the output field as output: github_document
(Do NOT use the default "output: html_document").
• Name your Rmd file as workout01-first-last.Rmd, where first and last are your
first and last names (e.g. workout01-gaston-sanchez.Rmd).
• Use Git to add and commit the changes as you progress with your HW.
• And don’t forget to push your commits to your github repository; you should push the
Rmd and md files, as well as the generated folder and files containing the plot images
and other outputs.
• Submit the link of your repository to bCourses. Do NOT submit any files (we will
actually turn off the uploading files option).
• No html files will be taken into account (no exceptions).
